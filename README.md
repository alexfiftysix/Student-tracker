### Student Tracker
This project is for tracking students, 
specifically students of private teachers who travel to their students' homes.

Teachers will be able to see their monthly. weekly, and daily schedule. 

Teachers can check off students every day when they've had their lessons, 
and when they've paid for their lessons.

The program will also calculate how much teachers should charge based on travel 
time+lesson time, and calculate the effective rate a teacher is making with their 
students for each term.  

### Technology
The program is python based, with a flask back-end, using SQLalchemy and a PostgreSQL database.
