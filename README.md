# Student Tracker
This project is for keeping track of students and teaching appointments, 
specifically for private teachers who travel to their students' homes.


### Core functionality

Teachers will be able to see their monthly. weekly, and daily schedule. 

Teachers can check off students every day when they've had their lessons, 
and when they've paid for their lessons, as well as adding notes to each 
student's profile.

### Additional planned functionality

The program will also calculate how much teachers should charge based on travel 
time+lesson time, and calculate the effective rate a teacher is making with their 
students for each term.  

documentation/kanban.txt has a text-based board of user stories to be implemented.

### Technology
The program is python based, with a flask back-end, using SQLalchemy and a PostgreSQL database.
